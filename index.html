				<p>Social science research has demonstrated that the human brain has evolved a strong ability to recognize and react to information but a fairly poor ability to recall information from memory. Other studies have shown that a more diverse group is generated when candidates are identified from a list, rather than selecting based purely on recall. The DiversifyMicrobiology site aims to help symposium organizers, award committees, search committees, etc. identify microbiologists who might diversify their pool.i</p>

				<h3>Join Us!</h3>
				<p>We are a group of students, postdoc, staff, and faculty who are committed to building a community of excellence at the University of Michigan around the area of reproducible data analysis. As a Carpentries Partner Organization, we use two day Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops to help members of the University of Michigan community to grow in their computer programming skills. From these workshops we seek to build a community of excellence by training people to become workshop helpers and instructors. Also, we continue to engage learners by offering specialty workshops that go deeper into content or explore topics not covered by the typical Carpentries workshops.</p>
